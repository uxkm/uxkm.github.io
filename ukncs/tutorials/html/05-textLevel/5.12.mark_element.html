		<h3>Wormhole Physics Introduction</h3>

		<p>
			<mark>A wormhole in normal conditions can be held open for a
			maximum of just under 39 minutes.</mark> Conditions that can increase
			the time include a powerful energy source coupled to one or both of
			the gates connecting the wormhole, and a large gravity well (such as a
			black hole).
		</p>

		<p>
			<mark>Momentum is preserved across the wormhole. Electromagnetic
			radiation can travel in both directions through a wormhole,
			but matter cannot.</mark>
		</p>

		<p>
			When a wormhole is created, a vortex normally forms.
			<strong>Warning: The vortex caused by the wormhole opening will
			annihilate anything in its path.</strong> Vortexes can be avoided when
			using sufficiently advanced dialing technology.
		</p>

		<p>
			<mark>An obstruction in a gate will prevent it from accepting a
			wormhole connection.</mark>
