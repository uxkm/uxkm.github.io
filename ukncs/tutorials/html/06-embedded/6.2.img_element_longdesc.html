<p id="des">The woman in the painting is wearing a flowing white dress. A large piece of intricately
	patterned fabric is draped over the side. In her right hand she holds the chain mooring the boat. Her expression
	is mournful. She stares at a crucifix lying in front of her. Beside it are three candles. Two have blown out.
